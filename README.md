# Quotes on Dev Starter

A WordPress starter theme for the Quotes on Dev project, forked from Underscores. Allowed us to play with AJAX, PHP, WP API's, and jQuery. This project also allowed us to practice our HTML, CSS, SASS skills.

## Project Features

- This project generates a quote when you click the 'Show me Another!' button without actually refreshing the browser.
- The Submit a Quote button will submit a new quote into the database to be reviewed and published. 
- Created 2 custom fields 


## Installation

### 1. Download me (don't clone me!)

Then add me to your `wp-content/themes` directory.

### 2. Rename the `quotesondev-starter-master` directory

Make sure that the theme directory name is project appropriate! Do you need `starter` or `master` in the directory name?

### 3. Install the dev dependencies

Next you'll need to run `npm install` **inside your theme directory** to install the npm packages you'll need for Gulp, etc.

### 4. Update the proxy in `gulpfile.js`

Lastly, be sure to update your `gulpfile.js` with the appropriate URL for the Browsersync proxy (so change `localhost[:port-here]/[your-dir-name-here]` to the appropriate localhost URL).

And now would be a good time to `git init` :)
